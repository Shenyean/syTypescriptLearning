This is my type script learning journey

## What is the major difference between typescript and javascript

| typesctipt                                            | Javascript                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| strongly typed                                        | dynamically typed           |
| less compile time error                               | more compilation time error |
| type script are translated to java script by compiler |                             |

### Type script config

The type script config file has some pretty interesting stuff to play with. one will be the root dir and out dir , which determines the fold which the TS is being read and compiled, and the folder where the generated JS file is stored.
source map will show how which code in the TS code maps to the JS code.

There are a few primitive type for type script, but one of the interesting one is any type. "any" if type script is unable to figure out the type . it is bad practice to be using 'any' type most of the time.

just like other strongly typed language, you can determine the type of the outout for tyepscript as well,.

** Hello World again **
Hello every one, even though i doubt if there is any one at all. I am back again, and i m very determined to complete the type script course on free code camp. 
### (Recall) what is any type?
if the type is undefine, it can be define as any but if you want to use any .. don't use any 
there is a config call no implicit any to turn off any``

today i will look at function in type script
