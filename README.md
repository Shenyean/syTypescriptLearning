| less compile time error                               | more compilation time error |

### Type script config

The type script config file has some pretty interesting stuff to play with. one will be the root dir and out dir , which determines the fold which the TS is being read and compiled, and the folder where the generated JS file is stored.
source map will show how which code in the TS code maps to the JS code.

There are a few primitive type for type script, but one of the interesting one is any type. "any" if type script is unable to figure out the type . it is bad practice to be using 'any' type most of the time.

just like other strongly typed language, you can determine the type of the outout for tyepscript as well,.
